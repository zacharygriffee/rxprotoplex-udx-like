# rxprotoplex-udx-like

A prototype alpha implementation of UDX-like streams and sockets, utilizing RxJS and Protoplex for high-performance, event-driven networking. **This is an early-stage concept**, and significant work is needed to fully realize its potential.

## Features

- **UDX**: The core class managing sockets, streams, and network interfaces with a simplified API.
- **UDXSocket**: Event-driven sockets for managing connections and data streams.
- **UDXStream**: Reactive streams with dynamic connection management.
- **Reactive Programming**: Built on RxJS for handling asynchronous data flows with ease.
- **Integrated Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logs for easier debugging and monitoring.

## Status

This project is in **prototype alpha**. The current implementation serves as a proof of concept, and many features and optimizations remain to be developed, including:

- Enhanced error handling.
- Robust performance testing.
- Additional metrics and monitoring tools.
- Comprehensive documentation and examples.

Expect breaking changes and incomplete functionality as the project evolves.
